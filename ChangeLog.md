## Changelog

### 2023-09-01 (1.1.14)
- Bumped version to correspond with completed patches so far.

- Removed code for the random placeholders in input fields and associated settings

- Considering rebranding again from Tesseract to Tachyon to reflect the project's *Photon*ic legacy.

- Added action buttons above posts to return to the feed and reload the comments



### 2023-08-31 (1.1.5)
- Began initial fork work

- Rebranded with new name and logo. Keeping base version of upstream project and incrementing it separately.

- Added missing route and logic for `/verify_email` so that admins can use Tesseract as their default UI without relying on Lemmy-UI to handle email verifications during signup (needs cleanup, but works and is secure).

- Rewrote Dockerfile to be a two-stage build on the `node:20-alpine` base.  Reduced resultant image size by ~400%

- Removed `/cors/{instance]` path on upload image handler since it is not needed when operating at same domain as Lemmy BE. This probably broke non-instance specific usage, so probably need to define that via server setting.

- Added additional Invidious instances to select as YouTube frontends.
  - To do: Move those to a settings dropdown and allow user to select one instead of choosing them at random.

- Added initial support for user-defined "open in new tab" behavior. Default setting has been established, env var support for setting default, and user settings panel added.  `Link` component now has additional attributes:  `title` for setting tooltips and `target` for determing `_self` (default) or `_blank`.
  - To do:  Update instances of `Link` where appropriate to adhere to the user's preference.

- Redesigned the layout of the Settings page. Removed UI toggles for features I'm planning to remove (specifically, "random placeholders"
