## Changelog
### 2023-08-31 (1.1.5)
- Began initial fork work

- Rebranded with new name and logo. Keeping base version of upstream project and incrementing it separately.

- Added missing route and logic for `/verify_email` so that admins can use Tesseract as their default UI without relying on Lemmy-UI to handle email verifications during signup (needs cleanup, but works and is secure).

- Rewrote Dockerfile to be a two-stage build on the `node:20-alpine` base.  Reduced resultant image size by ~400%

```

- Removed `/cors/{instance]` path on upload image handler since it is not needed when operating at same domain as Lemmy BE

- Added additional Invidious instances to select as YouTube frontends.
  - To do: Move those to a settings dropdown and allow user to select one instead of choosing them at random.
